# To run runtime scripts under runtime.d in task container,

# Here're the steps to onboard a new runtime script,
# 1. put it under runtime.d
# 2. give it a priority in [0, 100] and insert below in order
# 3. add the following format block, all runtime script should output to runtime.pai.stdout and runtime.pai.stderr
